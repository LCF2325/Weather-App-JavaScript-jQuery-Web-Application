JavaScript (weatherApp.js):

- Utilizes `$(document).ready()` to ensure DOM is fully loaded before executing scripts.
- Implements functions to update date and time every second, fetch weather data, and fetch pictures asynchronously.
- Handles errors gracefully, displaying appropriate messages for city not found or weather data unavailable.
- Dynamically constructs HTML to display weather information and weather icons based on API response.
- Changes background image dynamically based on weather conditions.
- Fetches pictures from Unsplash API based on user input, displaying a random picture from the results.

HTML (index.html):

- Organizes document structure using semantic HTML elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`.
- Provides input fields for city name and picture category, along with corresponding buttons for fetching weather and pictures.
- Assigns unique IDs to input elements for easy manipulation in JavaScript.
- Displays weather information and pictures in designated `<div>` containers (`weatherInfo` and `pictureContainer`).

CSS (style.css):

- Defines global styles for body, headings, input fields, buttons, and other elements for consistent appearance.
- Utilizes flexbox for layout structuring and responsiveness.
- Styles weather information display box (`#weatherInfo`) for readability and visibility.
- Positions weather icon appropriately within the weather box.
- Sets background images for different weather conditions, implementing transitions for smooth image changes.
- Styles picture container (`#pictureContainer`) for proper display of fetched pictures, applying shadow effects and border radius for aesthetics.
